###Race to Self-Actualization!

##Description
- This is a game that will allow two people to face off in a typing challange. 
- They will take turns re-typing prompts that they are presented with exactly how they are presented.
- Whichever player has a faster time in a round will win that round.
- When a player has won five rounds, the game is over.
- If there is time, the game will be styled to reflect climbing up Maslow's heirarchy of needs until they reach self-actualization.
